# Effects of Weather on Chicago Marathon Run Times

## Description 
This was my final project for CSCI 203, my introduction to computer science course at Bucknell University. This project extracts data from two csv files from Brian Rock on Kaggle including Chicago Marathon Results and Chicago Marathon Weather. The goal of my final project was to determine whether there is a correlation between weather, such as temperature, dew point, and wind speed, on Chicago Marathon Run times, specifically focusing on the top 50 United States male and female runners. My code creates various scatter plots of average weather data vs run time and average weather data vs average run time for various weather conditions. The scatter plots that were most useful in determining whether there is a correlation were the average weather data vs average run time plots. 
## Predicitons 
### Average Temperature vs Average Female Maration Times 
The run times at the extreme temperatures would be slower in the extreme hot and cold temperatures than the temperatures in the middle. 
### Average Temperature vs Average Male Maration Times 
The run times at the extreme temperatures would be slower in the extreme hot and cold temperatures than the temperatures in the middle. 
### Average Dew Point vs Average Female Marathon Times 
The run times at high dew points would be slower than the run times in lower dew points. 
### Average Dew Point vs Average Male Marathon Times 
The run times at high dew points would be slower than the run times in lower dew points. 
### Average Wind Speed vs Average Female Marathon Times 
There would be no correlation between wind speed and marathon times. 
### Average Wind Speed vs Average Male Marathon Times 
There would be no correlation between wind speed and marathon times. 
## Results 
### Average Temperature vs Average Female Maration Times 
Slight quadratic relationship with outlier points proving prediction correct. Times are slower in the extreme hot and cold, and faster in between, specifically 50 degrees fahrenheit. 
### Average Temperature vs Average Male Maration Times 
Linear relationship proving prediction wrong. Times are faster in the cold and slower in the heat. 
### Average Dew Point vs Average Female Marathon Times 
Possible slight linear relationship, proving prediction correct. Run times are faster in low dew points and slower in high dew points. 
### Average Dew Point vs Average Male Marathon Times 
Linear relationship, proving prediction correct. Run times are faster in low dew points and slower in high dew points. 
### Average Wind Speed vs Average Female Marathon Times 
Clear inverse relationship, proving prediciton wrong. Run times are faster in high wind conditions and slower in low wind conditions. 
### Average Wind Speed vs Average Male Marathon Times 
Clear inverse relationship, proving prediciton wrong. Run times are faster in high wind conditions and slower in low wind conditions.
